# How to Use the Code Review Issues

This guide explains how to use the comprehensive code review findings to improve the Ephemeris codebase.

## Overview

A comprehensive code review has been completed on the Ephemeris satellite tracking framework. The findings are organized into:

1. **Detailed Issue Files** - Individual markdown files for each major issue (`.github/ISSUES/*.md`)
2. **Summary Document** - Complete overview of all 35 issues (`CODE_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md`)
3. **Issue Tracking** - README with priorities and categories (`README.md`)
4. **Automation Script** - Script to bulk-create GitHub issues (`scripts/create-github-issues.sh`)

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Review the Summary

Start by reading the comprehensive summary:

```bash
cat .github/ISSUES/CODE_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md
```

This gives you an overview of:
- All 35 issues identified
- Severity ratings
- Impact analysis
- Recommended implementation order

### Step 2: Review Detailed Issues

Detailed issue files are available for the top 10 priority items:

```bash
ls .github/ISSUES/*.md
```

Each file contains:
- Problem description
- Current vs. expected behavior
- Code examples
- Proposed solutions
- Acceptance criteria
- Related issues

### Step 3: Create GitHub Issues

You have three options to create GitHub issues:

#### Option A: Automated Creation (Recommended)

Use the provided script to create all issues at once:

```bash
# Make sure GitHub CLI is installed and authenticated
gh auth login

# Run the script
./scripts/create-github-issues.sh
```

The script will:
- ✅ Read all issue files
- ✅ Extract titles and labels from frontmatter
- ✅ Create GitHub issues with proper formatting
- ✅ Apply appropriate labels
- ✅ Provide progress feedback

#### Option B: Manual Creation

Create issues manually through GitHub web interface:

1. Go to https://github.com/mvdmakesthings/Ephemeris/issues
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Open an issue file (e.g., `01-tle-parsing-error-handling.md`)
4. Copy the title from the YAML frontmatter
5. Copy the markdown content (skip the frontmatter)
6. Apply the suggested labels
7. Click "Submit new issue"

Repeat for each issue file.

#### Option C: GitHub CLI Manual

Create issues one at a time using GitHub CLI:

```bash
# Example for issue #01
gh issue create \
  --repo mvdmakesthings/Ephemeris \
  --title "Add proper error handling for TLE parsing" \
  --body-file .github/ISSUES/01-tle-parsing-error-handling.md \
  --label "bug,high-priority,enhancement"
```

## Working with Issues

### Understanding Issue Files

Each issue file follows this structure:

```markdown
---
title: "Issue Title"
labels: ["label1", "label2"]
---

## Description
What the problem is

## Current Behavior
How it works now (with code examples)

## Expected Behavior
How it should work

## Impact
Why this matters

## Proposed Solution
How to fix it (with code examples)

## Related Issues
Dependencies or related work

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Checklist of requirements
```

### Tracking Progress

Use GitHub Projects or Issues to track progress:

1. Create a project board
2. Add columns: To Do, In Progress, Review, Done
3. Add all created issues
4. Move cards as work progresses

### Dependencies

Some issues depend on others:

- Issue #15 (test coverage) depends on #01 (error handling)
- Issue #23 (SwiftLint) should be done after #01 and #03
- Issue #20 (README examples) should be done after #01 (API changes)

See "Related Issues" in each file for dependencies.

## Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Claim an issue** - Comment that you're working on it
2. **Create a branch** - Use descriptive name: `fix/tle-error-handling`
3. **Follow the acceptance criteria** - Check off items as you complete them
4. **Write tests** - Add tests for your changes
5. **Update documentation** - If you change public APIs
6. **Reference the issue** - In commit messages and PR description

### For Maintainers

1. **Prioritize issues** - Use the recommended order
2. **Review carefully** - Especially for critical fixes
3. **Update issue files** - If you discover new information
4. **Close completed issues** - Link to the PR that fixed it
5. **Track metrics** - Monitor code quality improvements

## Automation

### Creating All Issues

To create all issues at once:

```bash
./scripts/create-github-issues.sh
```

This will:
- Ask for confirmation
- Create issues one by one
- Show progress
- Report success/failure count

### Updating Issues

If you need to update issue content:

1. Edit the markdown file locally
2. Update the GitHub issue manually
3. Or close old issue and create new one with updated content

## Customization

### Adding More Issues

The summary document lists 35 total issues but only 12 have detailed files. To create more:

1. Use existing files as templates
2. Follow the same structure
3. Add YAML frontmatter with title and labels
4. Save in `.github/ISSUES/` directory
5. Update the README.md with new issue

### Modifying Labels

Update labels in the YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Issue Title"
labels: ["bug", "high-priority", "enhancement"]
---
```

Common label combinations:
- Critical bugs: `["bug", "high-priority"]`
- Enhancements: `["enhancement", "good-first-issue"]`
- Documentation: `["documentation", "good-first-issue"]`
- Technical debt: `["refactoring", "technical-debt"]`
