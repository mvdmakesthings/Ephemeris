title: "Remove unused Math.swift file"
labels: ["cleanup", "good-first-issue"]

## Description

The `Math.swift` file contains only an empty struct with no functionality. It appears to be a placeholder that was never implemented.

## Current Implementation

**Location:** `Ephemeris/Utilities/Math.swift`

```swift
//
//  Math.swift
//  Ephemeris
//
//  Created by Michael VanDyke on 11/25/20.
//  Copyright Â© 2020 Michael VanDyke. All rights reserved.
//

import Foundation

public struct Differential {
    private init() {}
}
```

## Impact

- **Confusion:** Empty file provides no value but suggests functionality
- **Clutter:** Unnecessary file in project structure
- **Maintenance:** Need to maintain file that does nothing

## Investigation

Looking at the name `Differential` and the project context, this was likely intended for:
- Differential equations for orbital mechanics
- Numerical differentiation methods
- Advanced orbital propagation

However, since it's empty and unused, it should be removed.

## Proposed Solution

### Option 1: Remove Entirely (Recommended)

Simply delete the file:
```bash
rm Ephemeris/Utilities/Math.swift
```

Then update Xcode project to remove reference.

### Option 2: Implement or Document Intent

If there are plans to add mathematical utilities:

```swift
/// Utilities for mathematical operations in orbital mechanics
public struct Math {
    private init() {}
    
    // TODO: Add numerical methods as needed
    // - Differential equation solvers
    // - Numerical integration
    // - Root finding algorithms
}
```

But this adds no value without implementation.

## Recommendation

**Remove the file.** If mathematical utilities are needed in the future:
1. They can be added to existing files (e.g., `Double.swift`)
2. Or created in a new file with actual implementation
3. Git history preserves the original file if needed

## Steps to Remove

1. Delete file from filesystem
2. Remove from Xcode project
3. Verify project builds
4. Verify tests pass
5. Commit change

## Related Issues

- Issue #14 (Empty MathTests.swift file should also be removed)

## Priority

**Low** - Cleanup item, not affecting functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Math.swift file removed from filesystem
- [ ] Xcode project updated (reference removed)
- [ ] Project builds successfully
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No references to Math.swift or Differential remain in code

## Bonus

If removing this file, also consider:
- Reviewing other files for similar unused code
- Removing `MathTests.swift` (Issue #14)
