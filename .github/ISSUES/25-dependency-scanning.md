title: "Add automated dependency scanning with Dependabot"
labels: ["ci-cd", "security", "automation"]
---

## Description

The repository lacks automated dependency scanning and updates. While the project currently has no external dependencies, setting up Dependabot will help maintain security and best practices as the project evolves.

## Current Behavior

- No automated dependency scanning
- No security vulnerability alerts
- Manual dependency management
- No GitHub Actions updates

**Impact:**
- Potential security vulnerabilities
- Outdated GitHub Actions
- Manual effort to track updates
- No proactive security monitoring

## Expected Behavior

Automated dependency monitoring and updates:
- Security vulnerability alerts
- Automatic update PRs
- GitHub Actions version tracking
- Swift toolchain updates (when using SPM)

## Proposed Solution

### Step 1: Enable Dependabot

Create `.github/dependabot.yml`:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  # GitHub Actions
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "github-actions"
    commit-message:
      prefix: "chore"
      prefix-development: "chore"
      include: "scope"
    
  # Swift Package Manager (when SPM support is added)
  - package-ecosystem: "swift"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "swift"
    commit-message:
      prefix: "chore"
    # Ignore major version updates (review manually)
    ignore:
      - dependency-name: "*"
        update-types: ["version-update:semver-major"]
```

### Step 2: Enable Security Alerts

In repository settings:
1. Go to Settings → Security & analysis
2. Enable:
   - ✅ Dependency graph
   - ✅ Dependabot alerts
   - ✅ Dependabot security updates

### Step 3: Configure Alerts

Create `.github/dependabot-alerts.yml` (optional):

```yaml
# Configure how to handle security alerts
alerts:
  # Auto-create issues for security vulnerabilities
  create-issue: true
  
  # Severity threshold
  min-severity: "low"
  
  # Auto-merge patch updates
  auto-merge:
    - dependency-type: "direct"
      update-type: "security:patch"
```

### Step 4: Add Security Policy

Create `SECURITY.md`:

```markdown
# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently supported versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities to:
- Email: [security@example.com]
- GitHub: Use private vulnerability reporting

Do not report security issues publicly until they have been addressed.

### What to Include

1. Description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Potential impact
4. Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial response:** Within 48 hours
- **Fix timeline:** Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days
  - High: 7-14 days
  - Medium: 14-30 days
  - Low: 30-60 days

## Security Best Practices

When contributing:
- Validate all user input
- Use safe string handling
- Avoid force unwrapping
- Handle errors gracefully
- Don't commit secrets

## Dependencies

This project minimizes dependencies for security:
- Foundation framework only (built-in)
- No external dependencies currently

When dependencies are added, we:
- Review security implications
- Monitor for vulnerabilities
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use minimal dependency tree
```

## Benefits

### Proactive Security
- Early warning of vulnerabilities
- Automatic security patches
- Reduced attack surface

### Maintenance
- Automatic dependency updates
- Reduced manual tracking
- GitHub Actions stay current

### Compliance
- Security audit trail
- Demonstrates due diligence
- Industry best practice

## Current Dependencies to Monitor

### GitHub Actions
- `actions/checkout`
- `actions/setup-node` (if using semantic-release)
- Custom action versions in CI workflow

### Future Dependencies (when SPM added)
- Swift packages (to be determined)

### Indirect Dependencies
- Xcode toolchain
- Swift compiler version
- iOS SDK versions

## Example Dependabot PR

When Dependabot finds an update:

```
Title: Bump actions/checkout from 3.0.0 to 3.1.0

Dependencies:
- actions/checkout: 3.0.0 → 3.1.0

Release notes:
[link to release notes]

Compatibility: ✓ All checks passed

[Auto-merge] [Ignore]
```

## Configuration Options

### Update Frequency
- `daily`: Check every day
- `weekly`: Check every Monday (recommended)
- `monthly`: Check first of month

### PR Limits
```yaml
open-pull-requests-limit: 5  # Max open PRs
```

### Auto-merge
```yaml
auto-merge:
  - dependency-name: "actions/*"
    update-types: ["version-update:semver-patch"]
```

### Ignore Specific Dependencies
```yaml
ignore:
  - dependency-name: "some-package"
    versions: ["1.x", "2.x"]
```

## Testing Strategy

After Dependabot creates a PR:

1. **Automated tests** run in CI
2. **Manual review** for major updates
3. **Merge** if tests pass
4. **Monitor** for issues

## Additional Context

- Priority: **Low** - Proactive security
- Effort: **30 minutes** setup
- Maintenance: **Automated**
- Related to: Issue #23 (CI/CD improvements)

## Future Enhancements

When adding dependencies:
- Use specific version pinning
- Document why each dependency is needed
- Regular dependency audits
- Consider alternatives to minimize dependencies
