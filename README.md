# Ephemeris - Satellite Tracker Framework

![CI](https://github.com/mvdmakesthings/Ephemeris/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

A Swift framework for satellite tracking and orbital mechanics calculations.

## CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. See [CI_CD.md](./CI_CD.md) for details about the build, test, and linting workflows.

## Online Resources
Here are some of the online resources I used or read to get a better understanding of the mechanics behind tracking orbiting bodies.
